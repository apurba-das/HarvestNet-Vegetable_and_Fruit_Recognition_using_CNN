The project "HarvestNet - Vegetable and Fruit Recognition using CNN" aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of produce classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
The project focuses on three main models: ResNet18, VGGNet16, and AlexNet, and evaluates their performance across three different datasets varying in the number of classes.

Libraries required to run your Python code:
Install and import these libraries - os, torch, torchvision, sklearn, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, seaborn using pip install command.

Steps to train/validate the model:
1. Upload the dataset into the drive.
2. Open the required notebook in Google Notebook.
3. Run all the cells and note the results.
   
Steps to run the pre-trained model on the provided sample test dataset
1. Upload the dataset into the drive.
2. Open the required notebook in Google Notebook.
3. Set the pre-trained value as true for transfer learning.
4. Run all the cells and note the results.

Source code package in PyTorch:
The PyTorch source code package for this project would encompass all the necessary components to build, train, evaluate, and optimize CNN models for vegetable and fruit recognition tasks. 
It includes - implementation of the CNN models (ResNet18, VGGNet16, AlexNet), data preprocessing steps, training and evaluation scripts, hyperparameter tuning configurations, and visualization tools for analyzing model performance.
